### Installation

### Testing

### Changes
See [CHANGELOG.md]() for detailed list of changes between releases.

### Upgrade
See [UPGRADE.md]() for information about actions needed when upgrading.

For production use we recommend you to upgrade only when new version is released and not to follow the master branch.

### Release
See [RELEASE.md]() for information about how to make a new release.

### Bug Tracker
Browse open issues and submit new ones in [Github Issues]().

We are dedicating the Github Issue only for bugs in our codebase. For general questions, start a new thread in the [Community forum]() instead of opening a new Issue.

After you have opened a new issue, the team will handle it according to these instructions: [How to handle Github Issues](https://github.com/wewillneverfail/ims-api/blob/master/how-to-handle-github-issues.md)
